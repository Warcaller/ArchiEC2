            <h1>Shortly about me</h1>
            <p>
              My name is Miroslav Hor√°k. I'm from the Czech Republic.
              <br />
              I am a Twitch streamer with a very small community.
              <br />
              I usually stream from Prague but occasionally I stream from my
              worse PC at home.
              <br />
              Since February 2021 I've been streaming also to Youtube.
              <br />
              I tried to stream to Facebook for a while as well but decided it
              isn't worth it.
              <br />
              I used to mainly stream Warcraft III but nowadays I stream more
              variety.
              <br />
              On Twitch i use my own chatbot. It's still work in progress.
              <br />
